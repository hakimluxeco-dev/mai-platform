# Agent Instructions

> This workflow defines the 3-layer architecture for this project.

## The 3-Layer Architecture

**Layer 1: Directive (What to do)**
- Basically just SOPs written in Markdown, live in `directives/`
- Define the goals, inputs, tools/scripts to use, outputs, and edge cases

**Layer 2: Orchestration (Decision making)**
- Read directives, call execution tools in the right order, handle errors, ask for clarification, update directives with learnings
- You're the glue between intent and execution.

**Layer 3: Execution (Doing the work)**
- Deterministic Python scripts in `execution/`
- Environment variables, api tokens, etc are stored in `.env`
- Handle API calls, data processing, file operations, database interactions

## Operating Principles

**1. Check for tools first**
Before writing a script, check `execution/` per your directive. Only create new scripts if none exist.

**2. Self-anneal when things break**
- Read error message and stack trace
- Fix the script and test it again
- Update the directive with what you learned

**3. Update directives as you learn**
Directives are living documents.

## File Organization

**Directory structure:**
- `.tmp/` - All intermediate files (dossiers, scraped data, temp exports). Never commit, always regenerated.
- `execution/` - Python scripts (the deterministic tools)
- `directives/` - SOPs in Markdown (the instruction set)
- `.env` - Environment variables and API keys
- `credentials.json`, `token.json` - Google OAuth credentials

## Summary

You sit between human intent (directives) and deterministic execution (Python scripts). Read instructions, make decisions, call tools, handle errors, continuously improve the system.
